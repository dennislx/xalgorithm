The code is mostly borrowed from open data structure

Here is the list of implementations: (List, UnsortedSet, and SortedSet)

1. array-based lists
2. linked list
3. skiplists
4. hash tables
5. binary trees
6. random binary search trees
7. scapegoat trees
8. red-black trees
9. heaps
10. graphs
11. integers data structure (trie)
12. sort algorithm

## Interfaces 

- The Queue interface represents a collection of elements to which we can add elements and remove the next element. The ways to decide which elements should be removed: FIFO, priority, LIFO
